# Notion-like Project Development Plan - Todo List

## Overview

This is a detailed plan to build a Notion-like personal knowledge management application using React, TypeScript, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. Initially planned as a local-first Tauri application, the project currently focuses on web implementation using React Router, with desktop integration as a potential future enhancement.

## Phase 1 Summary

**Completed Items:**
- Successfully set up development environment with React and TypeScript
- Implemented React Router for frontend navigation instead of Tauri
- Established PostgreSQL database with core schema design (Workspace → Page → Block)
- Created comprehensive API structure with CRUD operations
- Built functional UI for workspace management
- Implemented database models and relationships

**Challenges & Learnings:**
- No significant new technical challenges encountered, mostly applying existing knowledge
- Made strategic decision to postpone Tauri integration to focus on core functionality first

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and React Router
  - UI Framework: Tailwind and Radix UI
  - State Management: React Query
  - Rich Text Editing: BlockNote.js (block-based Notion-like editor)
- **Backend**: Node.js
  - API Framework: Express.js
  - ORM: Prisma
  - Storage: Standard server storage (filesystem integration via Tauri postponed)
- **Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities (planned)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
